# Devops Agent

## Introduction

The DevOps assistant helps DevOps engineerings by acting as the coordinator between code changes and system status by correlating GitHub activities with real-time infrastructure metrics from Grafana. By orchestrating between these two domains, it can proactively identify potential issues (like a problematic PR that might impact system health) and suggest preventive actions, essentially providing end-to-end visibility and automated decision support across the development and operations lifecycle.
